    [CMake] Use LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR instead of hardcoding /usr/include/libxml2
    
    `find_package(LibXml2 REQUIRED)` sets `LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR` to the correct
    include directory for the libxml2 headers. Use this variable instead of
    hardcoding `/usr/include/libxml2`. This allows the build to work with
    custom libxml2 builds on WASI.
